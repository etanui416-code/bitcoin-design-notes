Bitcoin Design Notes
This repository contains structured research and learning notes focused on Bitcoin wallet user experience (UX) and design considerations.
The goal of this project is to study how real users interact with Bitcoin wallets, identify common usability and safety issues, and document best-practice design patterns that improve adoption without compromising security.
Focus Areas
Wallet onboarding and first-time user experience
Seed phrase backup and recovery UX
Error handling and user education
Mobile-first Bitcoin wallet design
UX challenges in emerging markets
Why this matters
Poor UX leads to loss of funds, misuse of Bitcoin, and reduced adoption.
Clear, well-researched design improves security and usability without changing protocol rules.
Status
This is a learning-in-public and research repository.
Content will be expanded incrementally with notes, diagrams, and design analyses.
